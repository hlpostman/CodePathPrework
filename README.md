# Pre-work - *Gratuitor*

**Gratuitor** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **HLPostman**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [X] Euro/USD currency conversion from main view
- [X] Two-way tip/bill
- [X] *Customizable* tip/bill split always available from main view

## Notes

I didn’t get to implementing anything in the settings controller.
I haven’t succeeded yet in using the bill input text as a double for all my calculations and still formatting its separator for Euros.
